# Bayesian Time Series Prediction

This repository presents my Bachelor's Thesis in Physics, focused on time series prediction using Bayesian Statistics and Monte Carlo Methods based on Markov Chains (MCMC). Implemented in Python using PyMC and other scientific libraries, this project showcases how probabilistic inference can be applied to real-world data.

## 🔍 Overview

This project covers the following theoretical and practical components:

- Bayesian statistics and comparison with frequentist methods  
- Prior distributions (informative, non-informative, conjugate)  
- MCMC methods: Metropolis-Hastings and Gibbs Sampling  
- Posterior estimation and convergence diagnostics (trace plots, Gelman-Rubin statistic, corner plots)

## 🧪 Case Studies

1. **Temperature Modeling**  
   Predicting average monthly temperatures in Málaga using a sinusoidal model and Bayesian inference.

2. **Fasting Probability**  
   Modeling the probability of having eaten based on the time of day using logistic regression and Bayesian methods.

3. **Milankovitch Cycles**  
   Fitting sinusoidal models to historic global temperature data influenced by orbital variations over the last 80,000 years.

Each case study includes:
- Exploratory data analysis  
- Model definition and parameter selection  
- Posterior inference using PyMC  
- Visual diagnostics and interpretation
