# Bayesian Time Series Prediction with MCMC

This repository presents my Bachelor's Thesis in Physics, focused on time series prediction using Bayesian Statistics and Monte Carlo Methods based on Markov Chains (MCMC). Implemented with Python and PyMC, this project explores how Bayesian inference can be used to model uncertainty and update predictions dynamically.

## 🔍 Overview

Theoretical foundations:
- Bayesian statistics and comparison with frequentist approach
- Prior distributions (conjugate, non-informative)
- MCMC methods: Metropolis-Hastings and Gibbs sampling
- Diagnostic tools: Trace plots, Gelman-Rubin, Corner plots

## 🧪 Case Studies

1. **Temperature Modeling** – Predicting average monthly temperatures in Málaga using a sinusoidal model with PyMC.
2. **Fasting Probability** – Modeling the probability of having eaten based on the time of day using logistic regression.
3. **Milankovitch Cycles** – Applying sinusoidal models to historic global temperature variations over 80,000 years.

Each study includes:
- Exploratory data analysis
- Model definition with prior distributions
- Posterior inference using MCMC
- Visual diagnostics and interpretation

## 📁 Repository Structure
